This is a generalization of prior research which operated in a regime where FWM processes conserved spin and orbital angular momenta independently. We calculate the growth rates of new modes for both degenerate and nondegenerate pump configurations. Our theory is validated against numerical simulations for the cases where the generated signals are in the same SO mode(s) as the pump(s). We also calculate the growth rates of signals in SO modes other than the pumps.},

  abstract = {Utilizing the modes of a multimode fiber forms a frontier between what is achievable with current fibre technology and what is required for the remainder of the 21st century. Large mode area multimode fibers accommodate the high power delivery demanded by fiber lasers used in industry for precision cutting, welding and drilling functions, and used elsewhere for the generation of white light sources used in fiber communication, medical and precision time keeping applications. This thesis explores the theory of nonlinear effects in multimode fibers with the intention of optimizing existing applications, whilst simultaneously identifying new ones.{$<$}br/{$><$}br/{$>$}A generalized multimode nonlinear Schrodinger equation is numerically solved to explore the phenomenon of self-focusing in multimode fibers, with peak powers in the megawatt regime. Temporal effects compress femtosecond pulses launched into the fundamental mode, driving peak powers up and coupling power into higher order modes; a process identified with transverse spatial contraction and increased intensity. Parameter regimes in which damage may be avoided are identified. The nonlinear interaction of two modes under continuous wave pumping is solved analytically in terms of elliptic functions.{$<$}br/{$><$}br/{$>$}The nonlinear multi frequency dynamics describing the optical regeneration of optical communication signals are researched in a scalar single mode scenario, before nonlinear effects in polarization modes are explored. In the scalar case, a modification to a phase sensitive amplifier from the literature solves the problem of phase to amplitude noise conversion during regeneration. Improved bit error rates in three modulation formats are simulated as a result and experimental collaboration demonstrates proof of principle. Polarization assisted phase sensitive amplification (PAPSA) for signal regeneration is then introduced. Polarization mode benefits include operating power and fiber length reduction, simultaneous regeneration of signal phase and amplitude, and a simple way to decompose the signal into quadrature and in-phase components. An approximate analytic theory of PAPSA is developed. Experimental collaboration demonstrates that PAPSA offers significant signal bit error rate reduction{$<$}br/{$>$}},

This length is related to the common experimental observation that stimulated parametric emission is usually prominent only in short fibers while in long fibers stimulated Raman scattering dominates. Despite the fact that the actual process involves an intensity dependent bandwidth and broadening of the pump linewidth from self-phase modulation, it is possible to develop a simple expression for the characteristic length which requires only the initial pump linewidth and the low-power parametric bandwidth. This bandwidth can often be estimated from the pump wavelength and the measured frequency shift between the pump and the generated waves. Expressions for gain and amplification are derived from coupled wave equations and in the Appendixes it is shown that these are of the same form as the planewave equations, but modified by coupling coefficients called overlap integrals.},
