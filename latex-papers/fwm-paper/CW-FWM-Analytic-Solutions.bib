  abstract = {We study the generation of spin-orbit (SO) modes via four-wave mixing (FWM)-based parametric amplification. SO modes carry quantized total angular momentum (TAM), and we show that FWM processes that generate new signals conserve TAM. This is a generalization of prior research which operated in a regime where FWM processes conserved spin and orbital angular momenta independently. We calculate the growth rates of new modes for both degenerate and nondegenerate pump configurations. Our theory is validated against numerical simulations for the cases where the generated signals are in the same SO mode(s) as the pump(s). We also calculate the growth rates of signals in SO modes other than the pumps.},

All possible launch states are considered. The models describe sum- and difference-frequency generation, polarization dynamics, parity-time dynamics, and optical processing applications.},

The results can be used for obtaining the phase transfer function between any input wave and any output wave, a subject of interest for phase regeneration of communication signals.},

  abstract = {We find that the parametric four-photon gain for light pulses decreases for fibers longer than a characteristic length. This length is related to the common experimental observation that stimulated parametric emission is usually prominent only in short fibers while in long fibers stimulated Raman scattering dominates. Despite the fact that the actual process involves an intensity dependent bandwidth and broadening of the pump linewidth from self-phase modulation, it is possible to develop a simple expression for the characteristic length which requires only the initial pump linewidth and the low-power parametric bandwidth. This bandwidth can often be estimated from the pump wavelength and the measured frequency shift between the pump and the generated waves. Expressions for gain and amplification are derived from coupled wave equations and in the Appendixes it is shown that these are of the same form as the planewave equations, but modified by coupling coefficients called overlap integrals.},
